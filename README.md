# ip-wiki-gateway

> Gateway page that connects you to the Interplanetary Wiki.

## Experimental!

This module is still in very early research and development. You probably don't
want to use this.

## Usage

With an [IPFS](http://ipfs.io) daemon running:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/noffle/ip-wiki-gateway.git
$ cd ip-wiki-gateway
$ npm run publish
```

Then travel to that URL using the `https://v04x.ipfs.io` public gateway, or your
own IPFS daemon's gateway.
